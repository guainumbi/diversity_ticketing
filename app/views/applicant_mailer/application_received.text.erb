Dear <%= @application.name %>,

thank you for applying for a diversity ticket for <%= @application.event.name %> in <%= @application.event.city %>.

We will contact you after the applications are closed and when the winners of the diversity tickets are raffled out. Every conference is different, so we can’t tell you for sure how much the selection process will take; two weeks from the application deadline usually give us enough time to process all applications.

If you have further questions, you can reach us at diversityticketsorg@gmail.com

We cross our fingers for you,

The Diversity Tickets Team
